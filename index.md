### CPSC 120

 * Lab 4
Lab 4 part 1 was the first time I used a formula to calculate an end result, this is why this lab is one of my favorite. The objective was calculate how many days until the next event by converting two dates into Julian Days and then taking the difference which would print messages to the terminal. Lab 4 was also the first time I learn how to use the make command which allowed me to fix formatting and test cases against the code in order to fix errors.

 * Lab 5
 Lab 5 part 2 is one of my favorites because it was the first time I used arguments from the command line to execute the code. Part 2 was also the first time I used a for loop to add up the arguments and place them in a variable named sum. The goal was to use the sum of the arguments divided by the amount of arguments to calculate the average. This lab for me was the building block for future labs.

  * Lab 9
  Lab 9 part 2 is one of the more challenging labs that I completed which makes it to the favorite list. In this lab I had to create a spell checker program that scan a document file for misspelled words and used a dictionary file to determine which words are spelled properly and improperly.  This lab was also where a learn how to store content in a vector by using push back within a function then calling that function later in the code.
